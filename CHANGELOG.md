  - `padding`: The padding around the magnetic widget. This is an optional parameter.
  - `mobile`: A boolean value indicating whether the widget should respond to long press events on mobile(not yet tested for functionality). If false, only Web will work.
### Improved
- Performance optimizations in the code:
  - reduced the number of times renderBox.localToGlobal(Offset.zero) is called
  - moved the calculations for relX and relY inside the if (distanceMouseButton < distanceToTrigger) statement, so theyâ€™re only calculated if necessary.
